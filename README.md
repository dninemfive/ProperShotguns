# Proper Shotguns

## Overview
Pump shotguns and chain shotguns will fire 6 pellets simultaneously, rather than one single shot.

This also isn't like other similar mods in the sense that shotguns with this will fire buckshots properly, rather than technically fire one pellet after the other very quickly. This effect is most noticeable in shotguns that fire bursts such as the chain shotgun.
